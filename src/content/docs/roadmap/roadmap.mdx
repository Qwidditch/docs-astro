description: The roadmap for for Qwidditch UI
---

The aspiration is to be 1:1 compatible with Daisy UI so you can have all the benefits of Daisy UI but with the added benefit of being able to use it in Qwik.
On top of that we will be adding more components and utilities to make your life easier, this is possible as vanilla daisy comes with some downsides,
it's framweork agnostic which means there limited to using vanilla html for all of their components.\_createMdxContent
As this is a Qwik solution we can get much more specific in the types of components we can make.
And becasue we are using Qwik there's no overhead to make these complex components, unlike other solutions that may end up bloating the application.

Here's a Qwik guide to getting started with Qwidditch UI.

Qwidditch UI is built on top of tailwind and more specifically Daisy UI which is a component library that uses semantic class names. You can still use tailwind to your hearts content, these styles will then go and override the provided one from Daisy UI.

## Prerequisites

- 1 Install tailwind
- 2 Install daisyUI
- 3 Install clsx
- 4 Install tailwind merge
